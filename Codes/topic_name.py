So answer: "Topic: Some DS/algorithm, then Code snippet." So example: Let me pick a random DSA topic. Possible topics: Linked
- In a previous answer deliver: offline, one could choose "Heap", "Stack", "Queue", "Binary Search", "Threading", "Graph algorithms", "Dynamic programming". However question: "Give me a random DSA topic." It doesn't specify a specific algorithm or structure. Choose random "Trie" data structure! But a random topic might be: "Graph".

Alternatively let's choose "Depth First Search Implementation" algorithm for graphs. Possibly this is one of the topics in DSA. But I'd like to pick one that is neat and then writing a clean, commented code. Basic algorithm: Maybe "Binary Search Tree Insert" or "Heap Implementation".

Alternatively other possibility: "Merge Sort" which is fundamental algorithm; but merging often implemented in many languages. Alternatively I pick "Graph using Depth First Search" or "Priority Queue using Heap".

What are our possible topics: A DSA topic: "Red-Black Tree"? Possibly. Alternatively "B+ Tree"?

But perhaps base is "Binary Search Tree" or "AVL Tree" or "Heap" etc. Or I can choose "Graph Cycle detection algorithm using DFS".

Maybe I'll choose "Graph Cycle detection using DFS" (so comments). But let's re-read the prompt exactly: "Give me a random Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topic." It does not specify one from algorithm design paradigms. So possible topics: sort algorithms, search algorithms, trees, graphs. I look at provided format: "Topic: <topic name>" then code with block code.

Let's choose "Graph" with "Depth First Search" algorithm algorithm. Use a graph implementation and then DFS code. But is DFS not considered DSA topic? It's a "Graph traversal algorithm" embedded in "Graph Data Structure" (approx). Alternatively do "Trie Data Structure". 
Alternatively I may choose "Heap Sort algorithm" but I'd already discussed.

Let me check complexity: what is "priority queue" or "max-heap". But I'll choose "Graph - Depth First Search", because it's common and simple.

Alternatively, "Segment Tree" for range query problems, which is a common algorithm topic. But Segment Tree is a bit complicated come to code.

I'll evaluate "Caching data structure" maybe "LRU cache" is something that might be a random DS algorithm that is simple to implement. They are extremely common.

What about "Stack-based In-Order Traversal" but not as interesting.

Let's check parameters: "random data structures and algorithm topic".

I can choose "Cycle detection in a linked list" or "Double ended queue" as in "Deque" implemented with collections deque.

I want to pick an interesting algorithm that is core and easy to implement, and then I'll produce code with comments.

What about_topic: "Trie Data Structure for storing and quickly searching strings." But trie is not as frequently used in interviews as graph traversal; but it's sound.

I can choose "Minimax Algorithm" used in game theory maybe. But that algorithm is more than what is needed.

Alternatively a Graph Data structure and DFS algorithm might be the best because they require careful implementation details and code clarity.

I can choose "Binary Search Tree Insert" and "Tree Traversal" Show which is simple. But code might not require deep commentary.

Perhaps I'll choose "Heap" implementation. 
We want "clean and commented Python code" that demonstrates DSA algorithm used. Possibly "Binary Search Tree implementation" with "inorder traversal" code might be too simple though.

Maybe I'll choose "Graph" is good because then I can demonstrate building an adjacency list, and building graph with DFS function.

I can produce code:
